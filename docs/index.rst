textClust is a stream clustering algorithm for textual data which can be used to identify and track topics over time in a stream of texts. The algorithm uses a widely popular two-phase clustering approach where the stream is first summarised in real time. The result are many small preliminary clusters in the stream called 'micro-clusters'. Our micro-clusters maintain enough information to update and also efficiently calculate the cosine similarity between them over time, based on the TF-IDF vector of their texts. Upon request, the miro-clusters can be reclustered to generate the final result using any distance-based clustering algorithm such as hierarchical clustering. To keep the micro-clusters up-to-date our algorithm applies a fading strategy where micro-clusters that are not updated regularly loose relevance and are eventually removed.
